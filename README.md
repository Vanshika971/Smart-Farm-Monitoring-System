# Smart-Farm-Monitoring-System
Traditional farming in rural areas often suffers from inefficient irrigation and a lack of real-time monitoring, due to limited internet and power infrastructure. This project addresses these challenges by developing a Smart Farm Monitoring System that:
-Monitors temperature, humidity, and soil moisture in real-time

-Uses LoRa communication for long-range, low-power data transfer

-Displays data on a mobile app (Blynk)

-Emphasizes energy efficiency with deep sleep and threshold-based transmissions
